# Project Log

This file will contain a log of all the steps taken by the Gemini agent for this project.

## Task 1: Initial Setup

1.1. **`GEMINI.md` Creation:** Analyzed the directory and created a `GEMINI.md` file with a template for a code project to provide context for future interactions.
1.2. **`log.md` Creation:** Created this `log.md` file to record all subsequent actions.
1.3. **Log Format Update:** Updated the log format to use a `global_task.local_task` structure as requested.

## Task 2: Logging Convention

2.1. **Append for Logging:** Noted the instruction to append to the log file for future entries. To do this, I will read the file, append new content, and write the entire file back.

## Task 3: Running `app.py`

3.1. **Attempt to Run `app.py`:** Executed `python app.py` as requested by the user. The script failed with an `ImportError`.
3.2. **Identify Missing Dependencies:** Read `app.py` and identified `numpy`, `matplotlib`, and `scikit-learn` as likely missing dependencies causing the `ImportError`.
3.3. **Install Dependencies:** Executed `pip install numpy matplotlib scikit-learn` as instructed by the user. The installation completed successfully.
3.4. **Second Attempt to Run `app.py`:** Executed `python app.py` again. The script ran and produced output, but then failed with a `UnicodeEncodeError` when printing the R² value.
3.5. **Fix UnicodeEncodeError:** Modified `app.py` to replace the `R²` symbol with `R-squared` in the print statement to avoid the `UnicodeEncodeError`.
3.6. **Successful Execution of `app.py`:** Executed `python app.py` again. The script ran successfully, printed the output, and displayed the plot.

## Task 5: Streamlit Conversion

5.1. **Plan Streamlit Conversion:** User requested to convert `app.py` to a Streamlit application, allowing user input for `n`, `a`, and `var`.
5.2. **Install Streamlit:** Installed the `streamlit` library using `pip`.
5.3. **Create `streamlit_app.py`:** Created `streamlit_app.py` with the Streamlit application code, incorporating user input for `n`, `a`, and `var`.
5.4. **Run `streamlit_app.py`:** Executed `streamlit run streamlit_app.py` in the background. The Streamlit application should now be running.
5.5. **Rerun Streamlit App:** User reported inability to access the address and requested to kill the original process and rerun `streamlit_app.py`.
5.6. **Attempt to Kill and Rerun Streamlit:** Attempted to find and kill the previous Streamlit process (no active `python.exe` processes found). Now re-running `streamlit_app.py` without the background flag.
5.7. **Second Rerun of Streamlit App:** Executed `streamlit run streamlit_app.py` in the foreground. The app is running and displaying an email prompt in the terminal.
5.8. **Third Rerun of Streamlit App:** Executed `streamlit run streamlit_app.py` again as requested by the user.
5.9. **Fourth Rerun of Streamlit App:** Executed `streamlit run streamlit_app.py` again as requested by the user. The app is running and displaying an email prompt in the terminal.
5.10. **Review `streamlit_app.py`:** User reported inability to access the Streamlit app, so reviewing the code for potential issues.
5.11. **Troubleshooting Streamlit Access:** Reviewed `streamlit_app.py` code and found no issues. Provided troubleshooting steps for the user, including checking terminal output for URLs, ensuring no port conflicts, and trying different browsers.
5.12. **Fifth Rerun of Streamlit App:** Executed `streamlit run streamlit_app.py` again as requested by the user. The app is running and displaying an email prompt in the terminal.
5.13. **Check Streamlit Process Status:** User asked if the Streamlit app is still running. Attempting to verify process status.
5.14. **Streamlit Process Not Found:** Checked for processes listening on port 8501 using `netstat`, but no active processes were found. This indicates the Streamlit application is not currently running.
5.15. **Run Streamlit with Headless Flag:** Executed `streamlit run streamlit_app.py --server.headless true` as requested by the user.
5.16. **Add Intercept (b) Slider:** User requested to add a slider for the intercept `b` with a range of -10 to 10.
5.17. **Modified `streamlit_app.py` for Intercept Slider:** Modified `streamlit_app.py` to include a slider for the intercept `b` and updated the data generation and display accordingly.
5.18. **Sixth Rerun of Streamlit App (Headless):** Executed `streamlit run streamlit_app.py --server.headless true` again as requested by the user.
5.19. **Label Top 5 Outliers:** User requested to label the top 5 outliers in the Streamlit application.
5.20. **Modified `streamlit_app.py` for Outlier Labeling:** Modified `streamlit_app.py` to identify and label the top 5 outliers on the plot based on absolute residuals.
5.21. **Seventh Rerun of Streamlit App:** Executed `streamlit run streamlit_app.py` again as requested by the user.
5.22. **Eighth Rerun of Streamlit App (Headless):** Executed `streamlit run streamlit_app.py --server.headless true` again as requested by the user.

## Task 6: Git Operations

6.1. **Push to GitHub:** User requested to push everything to the provided GitHub repository.
6.2. **Initialize Git Repository:** Initialized a new Git repository in the current directory.
